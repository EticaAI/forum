# Etica.AI Forum

Etica.AI is at present a very small group of Latin Americans concerned with
gathering information about the philosophy and the use of automation and
artificial intelligence in which it privileges the human side of technology.

**We are concerned about long-term problems**: our current aim is to create the
basis for the real group of people to have an idea of the dangers and
especially the potential that automation and artificial intelligence can
help them make the world a less hostile place.

Etica.AI is non-profit. We are interested in people who already have work
with social impact, especially areas that may be affected very
negatively in the coming decades and have an interest in longstanding
cooperation. We have the ability to make you more productive in your
bureaucratic tasks before the general population has access in exchange for
you to help us have the technology and human capital needed in the future.

## [Anti-AI](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/projects/3)

Problems against society that could be mitigated with Anti Artificial Intelligence (Anti-AI) strategies.

The proposed solutions (if exist) could be a human+machine or a full "Anti-AI AI" (e.g. one AI against another AI).

The problems also do not need in the present day to have been fully automated by artificial intelligence, but real evidence, even with a large number of humans, should already be publicly known.
