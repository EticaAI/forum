## [Anti-AI](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/projects/3)

Problems against society that could be mitigated with Anti Artificial Intelligence (Anti-AI) strategies.

The proposed solutions (if exist) could be a human+machine or a full "Anti-AI AI" (e.g. one AI against another AI).

The problems also do not need in the present day to have been fully automated by artificial intelligence, but real evidence, even with a large number of humans, should already be publicly known.

## [Etica.AI resources](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/projects/2)

Let us collaborate so that the time spent helping Etica.AI be potentiated for positive impact in the world and allow those same people to have quality time with and for the humans who love them.
