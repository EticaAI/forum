# [Etica.AI Forum](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Etica.AI is at present a very small group of Latin Americans concerned with
gathering information about the philosophy and the use of automation and
artificial intelligence in which it privileges the human side of technology.

**We are concerned about long-term problems**: our current aim is to create the
basis for the real group of people to have an idea of the dangers and
especially the potential that automation and artificial intelligence can
help them make the world a less hostile place.

Etica.AI is non-profit. We are interested in people who already have work
with social impact, especially areas that may be affected very
negatively in the coming decades and have an interest in longstanding
cooperation. We have the ability to make you more productive in your
bureaucratic tasks before the general population has access in exchange for
you to help us have the technology and human capital needed in the future.

## [Forum](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

We use GitHub Issues feature at
[github.com/EticaAI/forum/issues](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/issues)
as our forum platform at this moment (is free, good integration with code
repositories and allows good accountability). The short URL is [forum.etica.ai](http://forum.etica.ai).

_Note 1: **If you are interested, send email to etica.of.a.ai@gmail.com to
talk with us and see other discussion channels**. Most discussions that are
project-oriented have their own forum (GitHub Issues, Facebook Groups) or
real time chatting (Rocket.Chat, Slack, Telegram and WhatsApp)._

_Note 2: at some point we could migrate to another plataform considering
usability for non-GitHub users, like a self-hosted Discourse. Use the short
URL [forum.etica.ai](http://forum.etica.ai) when sharing._

## [Anti-AI](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/projects/3)

Problems against society that could be mitigated with Anti Artificial Intelligence (Anti-AI) strategies.

The proposed solutions (if exist) could be a human+machine or a full "Anti-AI AI" (e.g. one AI against another AI).

The problems also do not need in the present day to have been fully automated by artificial intelligence, but real evidence, even with a large number of humans, should already be publicly known.

## [Etica.AI resources](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/projects/2)

What has been donated, borrowed or simply bought and which can be used by colleagues committed to the cause.
