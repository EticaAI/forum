## Discussion forums

### Managed by EticaAI

#### EticaAI/forum on GitHub (Languague used: English)
We use [github.com/EticaAI/forum/issues](https://github.com/EticaAI/forum/issues)
as our forum platform at this moment (is free, good integration with code
repositories and **allows good accountability**). The short URL is [forum.etica.ai](http://forum.etica.ai).

#### Other options (Languague used: local language)

If you are interested and only know Etica.AI via this GitHub, and not already
via another medium, send email to **etica.of.a.ai(at)gmail.com** to
talk with us and see other discussion channels. Most discussions that are
project-oriented have their own forum (GitHub Issues, Facebook Groups) or
real time chatting (Facebook Group Chat, Rocket.Chat, Slack, Telegram and
WhatsApp).

Please note that, with exception of mediums that already have inline translation
available (Like Facebook), we in some groups would kindly ask you to use machine
translation.
